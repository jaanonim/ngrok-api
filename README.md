# Ngrok Api

The Ngrok Api Mod is a convenient tool designed to simplify the process of accessing servers hosted using ngrok. With this mod, there's no need to manually copy and update the server address every time it changes. Simply obtain an ngrok API key from the person hosting the servers and add it to the mod's API key list.

Once the API key is added, the mod seamlessly integrates with ngrok's API, automatically fetching the most up-to-date address of the hosted servers. This eliminates the hassle of tracking and updating the server address manually, saving you time and effort.

## Key Features:

-   Automatic Address Retrieval: The mod connects to the ngrok API using the provided API key to fetch the current address of the hosted servers.
-   API Key Management: Easily add or remove API keys from the mod's list, allowing you to access multiple ngrok servers.
-   Seamless Integration: Once the mod is set up and the API key is added, it automatically update address, requiring no further manual intervention.

_Note: This mod does not host minecraft server or provide the API key. It is solely intended to simplify the process of retrieving minecraft server addresses hosted with ngrok by automating the task._

Enjoy effortless access to minecraft server addresses with the Ngrok Api Mod and say goodbye to the inconvenience of manual address updates!
